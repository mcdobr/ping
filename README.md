# ping

This is a clone of the classic arcade game Pong. It is 100% written in C++ with the help of the SFML library(http://www.sfml-dev.org/).


## Linux instructions

You need to install the SFML library to run this program. You can do this easily by running this simple command in a terminal (on Ubuntu/Linux Mint):

```
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```

Then to get the program itself and run it you need to use these commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/mcdobr/ping
cd ping
make
./ping
```
